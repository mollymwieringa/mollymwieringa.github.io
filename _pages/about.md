About me
======

*Interests*
In progress.

*Qualifications*
I will soon defend a doctorate degree in Atmospheric and Climate Science from the University of Washington. While at the UW, my work has focused on furthering the development of sea ice data assimilation frameworks. In 2025, I will begin a new role as an ASP Post-Doctoral Fellow at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, where I plan to use a combination of data assimilation, machine learning, and climate modelling methods to explore the monitoring and verification aspects of polar climate engineering proposals.

*Science Philosophy*
In progress.

*Teaching Philosophy*
In progress. 

Thanks for visiting!
